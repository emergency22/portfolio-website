## Synopsis

Gabe Guio and Alex Murillo, both graduates from Nashville Software School's Software Engineering Program found themselves in the middle of the tech recession of 2023, unemployed, and with time on their hands. Wanting to continue to expand on their skills and reinforce learned concepts, they decided to work together to build a template they could both utilize for portfolio websites to showcase their projects. As such, the "Portfolio Website" project was born.
